## Application General Description
### Description :
The application is a peer-to-peer recommendation system designed for friends. Users can share recommendations about various topics such as restaurants, books, movies, and more. The core functionality revolves around creating, sharing, discovering, and interacting with these recommendations within a social context.

### Architecture 
The application follows an onion (hexagonal) architecture. The backend is built with NodeJS, and the frontend is developed using React as a Progressive Web App (PWA). The API is implemented using GraphQL, and the data is stored in a PostgreSQL database accessed through the Prisma ORM.

## Core Functionalities Overview

### 1. Content Discovery and Feed Management
**Description**: Users can discover recommendations from their friends through a personalized feed. The feed displays posts containing recommendations, including author information, category, title, description, and an image. Users can interact with these posts through actions like liking, commenting, and sharing.
**Related Pages**: Feed screen page, profile-feedscreen page, feed-screen-search page

### 2. User Authentication
**Description**: The application provides a secure authentication mechanism, allowing users to log in using their email and password. A "Forgot password?" feature is also available to assist users in recovering their accounts.
**Related Pages**: Authentification page

### 3. Search and Filtering
**Description**: Users can search for specific recommendations or content within the application. The search functionality is integrated into the feed screen, allowing users to quickly find relevant recommendations based on keywords.
**Related Pages**: Feed screen page, feed-screen-search page

### 4. User Profile and Content Creation
**Description**: Although not explicitly detailed, the presence of user avatars and author information on the feed screen implies the existence of user profiles. Users can likely create and manage their profiles, as well as create and share their own recommendations.
**Related Pages**: Feed screen page, profile-feedscreen page

### 5. Navigation and Notifications
**Description**: A bottom navigation bar provides access to key sections of the application, including the feed, profile, groups/social, history, and notifications. This allows users to easily navigate between different functionalities and stay informed about relevant updates.
**Related Pages**: Feed screen page

# Software Architecture Manifest - Peer Recommendation System (Revised 2)

## Overview

This document outlines the software architecture for a peer-to-peer recommendation system designed for friends. The application allows users to share, discover, and interact with recommendations about various topics. The architecture follows a hexagonal pattern to ensure separation of concerns and testability. The backend is built with NodeJS, and the frontend is developed using React as a Progressive Web App (PWA). The API is implemented using GraphQL, and the data is stored in a PostgreSQL database accessed through the Prisma ORM. This document also addresses non-functional requirements, security, scalability, deployment, and other critical aspects of the system.

## 1. Goals and Objectives

*   **Primary Goal:** To provide a user-friendly platform for friends to share and discover recommendations.
*   **Key Objectives:**
    *   High availability and reliability.
    *   Scalability to handle a growing user base.
    *   Secure storage and handling of user data.
    *   Maintainability and ease of future development.
    *   Compliance with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR).

## 2. Architecture Diagram

*(This section would ideally contain a visual representation of the architecture, including the hexagonal layers, components, and their interactions. Since I cannot create images, I will provide a more detailed description of what the diagram would show.)*

The diagram would consist of the following elements:

*   **Title:** Peer Recommendation System Architecture
*   **Hexagonal Layers:** Clearly labeled concentric hexagons representing:
    *   **Inner Core (Domain):** Containing the `User`, `Recommendation`, and `Comment` entities.
    *   **Use Cases (Application Layer):** Representing the application logic, such as `Authenticate User`, `Create Recommendation`, `Get Feed`, etc. Arrows would indicate the flow of data and control between the Use Cases and the Domain entities.
    *   **Ports (Interfaces):** Representing the interfaces for interacting with external systems, such as `Authentication Port`, `Recommendation Port`, `User Port`, and `Search Port`.
    *   **Adapters (Infrastructure Layer):** Representing the concrete implementations of the Ports, such as the GraphQL API, Prisma Client, and Email Service.
    *   **Outer Layer (UI):** Representing the React Frontend, with components like `Feed Screen`, `Recommendation Card`, `Login Form`, etc. Arrows would indicate the flow of data and user interactions between the UI and the GraphQL API.
*   **Components:**
    *   **Backend:** NodeJS server with Express (for potential middleware), GraphQL API (Apollo Server), Prisma ORM, and PostgreSQL database.
    *   **Frontend:** React application with Apollo Client, Redux Toolkit (for state management), and Material UI (or similar component library).
    *   **External Services:** Email provider (e.g., SendGrid, AWS SES), Search service (e.g., Elasticsearch).
*   **Data Flow:** Arrows would illustrate the flow of requests and data between the different layers and components. For example:
    *   A user interaction on the `Feed Screen` triggers a GraphQL query to the `Fetch Feed` adapter.
    *   The `Fetch Feed` adapter calls the `Get Feed` use case.
    *   The `Get Feed` use case retrieves data from the `Recommendation` and `User` entities using the Prisma Client.
    *   The data is then returned to the `Fetch Feed` adapter and finally to the `Feed Screen`.
*   **Key Technologies:** Icons representing the key technologies used in the system, such as NodeJS, React, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, Prisma, Docker, and Kubernetes.
*   **Deployment Environment:** A cloud icon representing the deployment environment (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure).

This diagram would provide a clear and concise visual representation of the system architecture, making it easier for stakeholders to understand the different components and their interactions.
